# Phase 1 Lecture 5: POST Requests

## Objectives

By the end of today's lecture, you will be able to code a `fetch` to add an object to a JSON file.

## Lesson Plan

1. Run `json-server --watch db.json` to start the JSON server.
2. Render each character to the screen within the `<li>` tag.
3. Add an event listener to create a new object upon submission of the form.
    - Why must we use a submit event here? Why not another kind of event?
4. Add the new object to the db.json file.
    - What is a **POST** request?
    - With our newfound information on `fetch`, why is it so necessary to both GET and POST requests?
5. Render the new object to the screen.
    - Does this new object persist? Why?

## Looking Ahead

Monday's lecture will round out the four basic `fetch` requests we will be learning by adding a PATCH request and a DELETE request.
